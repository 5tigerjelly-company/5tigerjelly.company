        <h1>Simply Screenshot - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Our screenshot extension must have a privacy policy because it collects user data, specifically the
            screenshots captured by users, their annotations, and related metadata. The privacy policy ensures that
            users are informed about what data is collected, how it is used, and how it is protected. This transparency
            builds trust and ensures compliance with legal requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            We collect screenshots, annotations, titles, and timestamps. For premium users, we may also collect data
            related to cloud storage and sharing.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>
            The collected data is used solely to provide and improve the extension's functionality. Screenshots and
            related data are stored locally within the browser, and optionally, in cloud storage for premium users.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access or
            disclosure.
        </p>

        <h2>User Control</h2>
        <p>
            Users have control over their data, including the ability to delete screenshots and related metadata.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            If applicable, we disclose the involvement of third-party services, such as cloud storage providers, and how
            they handle user data.
